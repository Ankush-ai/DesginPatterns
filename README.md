## Introduction

Design patterns are proven solutions to common software design problems. This repository aims to demonstrate the implementation of key design patterns in JavaScript, helping you write cleaner, reusable, and maintainable code.

## Design Patterns

### Null Object Pattern

The Null Object pattern provides a way to handle null or undefined values gracefully by substituting them with a neutral object. It helps prevent null reference errors and simplifies code logic.

### Builder Pattern

The Builder pattern separates the construction of complex objects from their representation. It allows you to create objects step by step, providing flexibility and ease of use in constructing complex instances.

### Singleton Pattern

The Singleton pattern ensures that only one instance of a class is created and provides a global access point to that instance. It is useful when you want to restrict object instantiation or manage shared resources.

### Command Pattern

The Command pattern encapsulates a request as an object, allowing you to parameterize clients with queues, requests, and operations. It promotes loose coupling between the sender and receiver, enabling the execution of various requests.

### Facade Pattern

The Facade pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex system or a set of classes. It hides the complexities of the subsystem and offers a unified interface for clients, promoting loose coupling and encapsulation.

## Usage

Each design pattern is provided in its own directory, containing example code and detailed explanations. Feel free to explore and adapt the code for your projects.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have any improvements, suggestions, or new design pattern implementations, please submit a pull request. Let's make this repository a valuable resource for the JavaScript community.
